## Hello there 👋

I'm Luiz, a Brazilian data professional passionate about the entire process of building incredible data platforms 📊

As an experienced Analytics Engineer with a proven track record in leading complex data projects, I am comfortable handling all the steps involved in creating bespoke analytics solutions, such as:
* Data extraction from multiple sources
* Building and ingesting it into data warehouses and data lakes
* Creating high-performance ETL pipelines to move data through stages
* Modeling with top-notch tools like Spark and SQL
* Creating beautiful, personalized dashboards to support data-driven decisions

I'm always looking to improve my knowledge of new tools and working on personal projects that are eventually uploaded here 😁
